        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, known as the SHANTI Bill, recently passed by the Lok Sabha, aims to revolutionize India's nuclear power sector. On the surface, it presents itself as a legislative measure designed to open the doors for private participation in nuclear energy. This bill is a significant legislative overhaul, as it replaces two crucial existing acts: the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act of 2010. The government champions the SHANTI Bill as a vehicle for two major reforms, intending to propel India's nuclear capabilities forward.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Issues</h2>
            <p>The SHANTI Bill introduces two primary reforms. Firstly, it seeks to permit private companies to establish and operate nuclear power plants in India for the very first time. Secondly, it purports to resolve the long-standing challenges associated with civil nuclear liability. The CLND Act of 2010, particularly its Section 17, has historically been criticized for deterring private investment in the nuclear sector. Section 17(a) allowed plant operators a “right of recourse” against equipment suppliers, while Section 17(b) permitted operators to claim damages from suppliers for accidents resulting from supplier acts or negligence. The SHANTI Bill addresses this by completely eliminating liability exposure for suppliers and capping the liability of the plant operator.</p>
            <p>While the elimination of supplier liability might appear to attract private capital, a deeper analysis reveals a shift in the burden: the State, and by extension, its citizens, would ultimately bear the financial responsibility for damages in the event of a nuclear accident. This approach is taken despite the potential for insurance-based solutions. The government's optimism for a surge in private investment, particularly amid renewed global interest in small modular reactors (SMRs), may be premature. A significant impediment remains: the government continues to retain complete control over nuclear fuel, the sector's most critical component. This control persists even as new fuel technologies like Clean Core Thorium's ANEEL fuel (which could facilitate India's entry into the thorium cycle) and various high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuels are emerging globally. The Bill's effective denial of access to these advanced fuel technologies for private operators, coupled with government monopoly over the fuel cycle, raises concerns about rent-seeking.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The SHANTI Bill represents a pivotal, yet complex, step for India's nuclear energy ambitions. While aiming to foster private sector involvement and resolve liability issues, its actual implementation presents a "sobering reality." The strategy to attract private investment by absolving suppliers of liability and capping operator liability essentially externalizes the risk, transferring the ultimate financial burden of a nuclear accident to the public exchequer and citizens. This could undermine the principles of accountability for industrial risks.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the government's continued monopoly over the nuclear fuel cycle, despite global advancements and the promise of new fuel technologies such as those developed by Clean Core Thorium, significantly limits the scope and effectiveness of private participation. Denying private plant operators access to diverse fuel options hinders innovation, reduces competitive efficiency, and invites potential rent-seeking, directly contradicting the spirit of liberalization and private sector engagement. Proliferation concerns, while valid, could be addressed through robust international safeguards and stringent domestic oversight rather than through a monopolistic control that stifles technological progress and market development.</p>
            <p>On a positive note, the Bill grants statutory backing to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), making it directly accountable to Parliament instead of the Atomic Energy Commission. This move towards regulatory independence is a welcome reform, enhancing transparency and oversight. However, the practical impact of this independence will largely depend on the presence of a truly competitive and diverse nuclear landscape, requiring multiple players for the regulator to effectively oversee.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
            <p>From a governance perspective, the SHANTI Bill introduces both progressive elements and potential pitfalls. The conferral of statutory backing to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is a significant stride towards strengthening regulatory independence and accountability. By making AERB directly answerable to Parliament, the Bill enhances legislative oversight over nuclear safety, a critical public concern. This aligns with principles of good governance that advocate for autonomous regulatory bodies free from direct executive control, fostering greater trust and transparency.</p>
            <p>Conversely, the Bill's approach to liability and fuel control raises crucial governance questions. Shifting the primary financial burden of nuclear accidents to the State and citizens, while capping operator liability and exempting suppliers, could be seen as an implicit subsidy to the private sector at public risk. This dilution of corporate accountability might conflict with principles of fair risk distribution and public interest. Moreover, the government's monopolistic control over nuclear fuel despite opening the sector to private players, and the associated risks of rent-seeking, highlights a tension between promoting private participation and maintaining state control over strategic assets. Robust mechanisms for checks and balances, and clear ethical guidelines, would be crucial to mitigate these risks and ensure equitable governance in the nuclear sector.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Way Forward</h2>
            <p>To truly unlock the potential of India's nuclear sector and attract meaningful private investment, a more balanced and forward-looking approach is necessary. First, the liability framework needs reconsideration to ensure a fair distribution of risk, possibly by implementing comprehensive, market-based insurance solutions that do not disproportionately burden the State and citizens. Second, while security concerns are paramount, a gradual and regulated opening of access to advanced nuclear fuel technologies for private operators should be explored. This could stimulate innovation, reduce costs, and accelerate India's transition to newer fuel cycles like thorium, while robust safeguards and international oversight protocols can address proliferation risks effectively.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, for the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)'s newfound independence to be truly effective, the government must foster a genuinely competitive environment with multiple players. This would provide the AERB with a diverse operational landscape to regulate, reinforcing its role as an independent oversight body. Promoting research and development in indigenous fuel cycle technologies and SMRs through private-public partnerships can also be a game-changer. Ultimately, the way forward involves striking a delicate balance between national security, economic development, private sector engagement, and public safety, guided by transparency and robust regulatory mechanisms.</p>
