    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI Bill)</strong>, passed by the Lok Sabha, aims to reform India's nuclear power sector.</p>
    <p>It replaces the <strong>Atomic Energy Act, 1962</strong> and the <strong>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010</strong>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Private Participation:</strong> The Bill allows private companies to set up nuclear power plants for the first time in India.</li>
        <li><strong>Civil Nuclear Liability:</strong> The Bill seeks to remove the 'irritant' of civil nuclear liability, particularly concerning equipment suppliers.</li>
        <li><strong>Liability Exposure for Suppliers:</strong> The SHANTI Bill eliminates liability exposure for suppliers altogether.</li>
        <li><strong>Operator Liability Cap:</strong> The liability of the plant operator is capped under the Bill.</li>
        <li><strong>State Burden:</strong> The State, and ultimately citizens, are left to bear the burden of damages in the event of a nuclear accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Fuel Control:</strong> The government retains complete control over nuclear fuel, denying private operators access to new fuel technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Independence:</strong> The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is granted statutory backing and direct accountability to Parliament.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>While the SHANTI Bill appears to open the nuclear sector to private participation, a closer examination reveals a more nuanced reality. The removal of liability for equipment suppliers and the capping of operator liability effectively shifts the ultimate burden of damages from private entities to the State and citizens. This move is intended to attract private investment, especially with the global resurgence of interest in small modular reactors. However, the continued government monopoly over nuclear fuel, despite the emergence of new fuel technologies like those developed by Clean Core Thorium (ANEEL fuel) and globally available HALEU fuels, significantly limits the scope of private participation and poses a risk of rent-seeking.</p>
    <p>The statutory backing of the AERB is a positive step towards regulatory independence, making it accountable to Parliament. However, the effectiveness of this independence hinges on the presence of multiple entities for the regulator to oversee, which may not be immediately realized given the controlled nature of the fuel cycle.</p>

    <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Article 298</strong> (Power to carry on trade, etc.) could be relevant regarding the State's role in conducting business, including the nuclear sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Parliamentary Oversight:</strong> The grant of statutory backing to the AERB and its direct accountability to Parliament strengthens governance and oversight mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegation of Powers:</strong> The Bill involves the delegation of regulatory and operational responsibilities, which need to be clearly defined and managed to prevent misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Accountability:</strong> The shifting of liability to the State raises questions about public accountability and the protection of citizen interests in case of accidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why it matters for UPSC</h2>
    <p><strong>GS Paper I: Society</strong> - Impact of technological advancements and policy changes on societal well-being (e.g., safety concerns).<br>
    <strong>GS Paper II: Governance</strong> - Regulatory frameworks, parliamentary oversight, accountability of statutory bodies, public interest litigation, role of the state in strategic sectors.<br>
    <strong>GS Paper III: Economy</strong> - Infrastructure development, industrial policy, foreign investment, energy security, economic implications of nuclear technology.<br>
    <strong>GS Paper III: Science and Technology</strong> - Nuclear energy, emerging technologies (SMRs, thorium cycle, HALEU fuels), regulatory challenges.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Liability Framework:</strong> Reconsider the liability framework to ensure a more equitable distribution of risk, potentially through robust insurance mechanisms that protect the State and citizens adequately.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Cycle Liberalization:</strong> Explore mechanisms to allow private participation in the development and utilization of advanced nuclear fuel technologies, while maintaining stringent safeguards against proliferation.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthening Regulatory Independence:</strong> Ensure the AERB has adequate resources and autonomy to effectively oversee a potentially growing and diverse nuclear sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Consultation:</strong> Engage in thorough public consultation to address concerns regarding nuclear safety, liability, and the long-term implications of privatizing aspects of the nuclear sector.</li>
        <li><strong>International Best Practices:</strong> Align India's nuclear liability framework and regulatory practices with international standards and conventions to foster global trust and investment.</li>
    </ul>
