    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill</strong>, also known as the <strong>SHANTI Bill</strong>, has been passed by the Lok Sabha. It aims to reform India's nuclear power sector.</p>
    <p>The SHANTI Bill replaces the <strong>Atomic Energy Act, 1962</strong> and the <strong>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010</strong>.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Private Participation:</strong> The Bill, on the surface, allows private companies to set up nuclear power plants for the first time in India.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Liability:</strong> It claims to resolve the issue of civil nuclear liability, particularly Section 17 of the CLND Act, which was seen as a deterrent to private investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplier Liability:</strong> The SHANTI Bill removes liability for equipment suppliers, capping the liability of the plant operator.</li>
        <li><strong>State Burden:</strong> This effectively leaves the State and citizens to bear the burden of damages in case of a nuclear accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Control:</strong> The government retains complete control over nuclear fuel, limiting access to new fuel technologies for private operators. This is despite the emergence of technologies like Clean Core Thorium's ANEEL fuel and global availability of HALEU fuels.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Independence:</strong> The Bill grants statutory backing to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), making it accountable to Parliament.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>While the SHANTI Bill opens the door for private players in nuclear power generation, its implications are complex.</p>
    <p>The removal of supplier liability is intended to attract private capital, but it shifts the ultimate risk to the public. The retention of government control over nuclear fuel is a significant bottleneck, preventing potential advancements and innovation, especially concerning thorium-based fuel cycles.</p>
    <p>The move to make the AERB directly accountable to Parliament is a positive step for regulatory independence. However, its effectiveness will depend on the presence of multiple entities for it to oversee.</p>

    <p><strong>GS Paper II: Governance, Constitution, Politics</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Changes in legislative frameworks governing critical sectors like energy.</li>
        <li>Role and independence of regulatory bodies.</li>
        <li>Public accountability and risk allocation in infrastructure projects.</li>
        <li>Impact of policy on private sector participation and economic growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>GS Paper III: Economy, Science and Technology</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy security and diversification of energy sources.</li>
        <li>Technological advancements in nuclear energy (e.g., small modular reactors, thorium cycle).</li>
        <li>Challenges and opportunities in the nuclear power sector.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity on Liability:</strong> While insurance solutions can be considered, clearer provisions for public safety and compensation mechanisms are needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Access:</strong> Re-evaluation of policies regarding private sector access to advanced nuclear fuel technologies to foster innovation and competitiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust Oversight:</strong> Strengthening the AERB's capabilities and ensuring genuine regulatory independence, especially with potential growth in the sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Balancing Interests:</strong> Finding a balance between attracting private investment, ensuring public safety, and maintaining strategic control over critical nuclear materials.</li>
    </ul>
