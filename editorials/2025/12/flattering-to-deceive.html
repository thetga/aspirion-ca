    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI Bill)</strong>, passed by the Lok Sabha, aims to reform India's nuclear power sector.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private Participation:</strong> The Bill allows private companies to set up nuclear power plants for the first time in India.</li>
      <li><strong>Civil Nuclear Liability:</strong> It replaces the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010.</li>
      <li><strong>Supplier Liability:</strong> The SHANTI Bill eliminates liability exposure for equipment suppliers, which was a contentious issue under Section 17 of the CLND Act, 2010.</li>
      <li><strong>Operator Liability:</strong> The liability of the plant operator is capped.</li>
      <li><strong>State Burden:</strong> The State and citizens may bear the burden of damages in case of a nuclear accident.</li>
      <li><strong>Nuclear Fuel Control:</strong> The government retains complete control over nuclear fuel, denying private operators access to new fuel technologies like thorium-based fuel (e.g., Clean Core Thorium's ANEEL fuel) and HALEU fuels.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Independence:</strong> The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is granted statutory backing and made accountable directly to Parliament.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>While the SHANTI Bill signals an opening of the nuclear sector to private players and seeks to address concerns over civil nuclear liability, its impact is tempered by significant limitations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The removal of supplier liability is intended to attract private investment but shifts the ultimate risk to the public.</li>
      <li>Retaining government control over nuclear fuel restricts the adoption of advanced and potentially more efficient fuel technologies. This could hinder the growth and diversification of India's nuclear program.</li>
      <li>The grant of statutory backing to AERB is a positive step towards regulatory independence. However, its effectiveness will depend on the presence of multiple operators for it to oversee.</li>
      <li>Concerns about proliferation are acknowledged, but the Bill's approach to fuel control might be less effective than robust safeguards and oversight.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Bill potentially impacts the principles of **public accountability** and **risk allocation** within the energy sector.</li>
      <li>The **statutory independence of the AERB** directly to Parliament enhances **institutional governance** and **oversight**.</li>
      <li>The concentration of control over nuclear fuel in government hands raises questions about **economic liberalization** and **competitive markets**.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why it matters for UPSC</h2>
    <p>This development is crucial for UPSC aspirants and can be linked to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GS Paper I: Society</strong> - Impact of industrial development and policy on public safety.</li>
      <li><strong>GS Paper II: Governance</strong> - Regulatory bodies, accountability mechanisms, policy formulation and implementation.</li>
      <li><strong>GS Paper II: Government Policies and Interventions</strong> - Energy policy, economic reforms, public-private partnerships.</li>
      <li><strong>GS Paper III: Economy</strong> - Infrastructure, industrial policy, investment in critical sectors.</li>
      <li><strong>GS Paper III: Science and Technology</strong> - Nuclear energy, emerging technologies, fuel cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>GS Paper III: Security Challenges</strong> - Nuclear proliferation concerns, safeguards.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop robust insurance mechanisms and compensation frameworks to effectively manage the risks associated with nuclear accidents, even with capped operator liability.</li>
      <li>Explore options for private sector participation in the nuclear fuel cycle, alongside stringent regulatory oversight and safeguards, to foster innovation and leverage new fuel technologies.</li>
      <li>Ensure the AERB, now with statutory backing, is adequately resourced and empowered to effectively regulate a potentially expanding nuclear sector with diverse players.</li>
      <li>Foster transparency and public engagement regarding the risks and benefits of nuclear energy and the implications of the SHANTI Bill.</li>
    </ul>
