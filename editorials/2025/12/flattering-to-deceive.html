        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill</strong> (SHANTI Bill) has been passed by the Lok Sabha. It aims to reform India's nuclear power sector.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The SHANTI Bill replaces the <strong>Atomic Energy Act, 1962</strong> and the <strong>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010</strong>.</li>
            <li>It permits <strong>private companies</strong> to establish nuclear power plants for the first time in India.</li>
            <li>It seeks to address the issue of <strong>civil nuclear liability</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Bill <strong>eliminates liability exposure for equipment suppliers</strong> and caps the liability of the plant operator.</li>
            <li>The government retains <strong>complete control over nuclear fuel</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Bill grants <strong>statutory backing to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)</strong>, making it directly accountable to Parliament.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Aspect</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Private Participation</td>
                    <td>Opens the sector to private companies, potentially boosting investment, especially with interest in small modular reactors.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Civil Liability</td>
                    <td>Section 17 of the CLND Act, which allowed recourse against suppliers, has been removed. Liability is capped for operators, shifting the ultimate burden to the State and citizens.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nuclear Fuel Control</td>
                    <td>The government's complete control over nuclear fuel is a significant limitation for private operators. This comes at a time when new fuel technologies (e.g., thorium cycle, HALEU fuels) are emerging globally. Denying private access to fuel technologies is seen as a missed opportunity.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Regulatory Independence</td>
                    <td>Granting statutory backing to AERB is a positive step towards regulatory independence. However, its practical impact depends on the presence of multiple players for the regulator to oversee.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The Bill appears to bet on increased private investment by removing supplier liability. However, retaining exclusive control over nuclear fuel limits the scope for innovation and private sector growth. The shift in liability burden is a critical concern.</p>

        <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The AERB's direct accountability to Parliament enhances governance.</li>
            <li><strong>State Responsibility:</strong> The Bill places the ultimate burden of damages from nuclear accidents on the State, raising questions about risk allocation and public safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Policy:</strong> The Bill reflects the government's policy on encouraging private participation in strategic sectors.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Why it matters for UPSC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GS Paper I: Society</strong> - Impact of industrial policies on public safety.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper II: Governance</strong> - Regulatory bodies, accountability, legislative processes.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper II: Polity</strong> - Constitutional provisions related to state responsibility.</li>

    <section>
        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Robust Oversight:</strong> Implement strong safeguards and oversight mechanisms to address proliferation concerns effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Fuel Policy Review:</strong> Reconsider the exclusive government control over nuclear fuel to allow private sector access to new fuel technologies and foster innovation.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance Solutions:</strong> Explore and implement comprehensive insurance-based solutions to manage nuclear liability effectively, ensuring adequate protection for citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthen Regulatory Independence:</strong> Ensure the AERB has the necessary resources and autonomy to effectively regulate a potentially growing private nuclear sector.</li>
