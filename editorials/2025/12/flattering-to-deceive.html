        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI Bill)</strong>, passed by the Lok Sabha, aims to reform India's nuclear power sector.</p>
        <p>It replaces the <strong>Atomic Energy Act, 1962</strong> and the <strong>Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010</strong>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private Participation:</strong> Allows private companies to set up nuclear power plants for the first time.</li>
            <li><strong>Civil Nuclear Liability:</strong> Aims to remove the perceived obstacle of civil nuclear liability for private investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Supplier Liability:</strong> The SHANTI Bill eliminates liability exposure for equipment suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Operator Liability:</strong> Liability of the plant operator is capped.</li>
            <li><strong>State/Citizen Burden:</strong> The State, and ultimately citizens, may bear the burden of damages in case of an accident.</li>
            <li><strong>Fuel Control:</strong> Government retains complete control over nuclear fuel, denying private operators access to new fuel technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Independence:</strong> Grants statutory backing to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), making it accountable to Parliament.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>While the Bill opens the sector to private players, it shifts the ultimate burden of accident damages to the State/citizens by removing supplier liability and capping operator liability.</p>
        <p>The government's expectation of a surge in private investment may be optimistic due to continued government control over nuclear fuel, a critical element.</p>
        <p>New fuel technologies, such as those developed by Clean Core Thorium (ANEEL fuel) and globally available HALEU fuels, are inaccessible to private operators.</p>
        <p>Vesting full control of the fuel cycle in the government is seen as an invitation to rent-seeking, with proliferation concerns better addressed through robust safeguards.</p>
        <p>The statutory backing of the AERB is a positive step towards regulatory independence, but its practical impact depends on having multiple entities for the regulator to oversee.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
        <p>The Bill raises questions about the allocation of risk and responsibility in a high-stakes sector. The shift of liability burden to the State has implications for public finances and citizen welfare.</p>
        <p>The grant of statutory backing to the AERB strengthens its institutional framework and accountability, aligning with principles of good governance and independent oversight.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters for UPSC</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GS Paper I: Society</strong> - Impact of policy on citizen safety and financial burden.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper II: Governance</strong> - Regulatory independence, accountability of statutory bodies, role of the state vs. private sector.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper II: Polity</strong> - Legislative process, parliamentary oversight.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper III: Economy</strong> - Private sector participation, investment in strategic sectors.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper III: Science and Technology</strong> - Nuclear energy, fuel cycle technology, regulatory frameworks.</li>
            <li><strong>GS Paper III: Security</strong> - Nuclear proliferation concerns, safeguards.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Way Forward</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement robust safeguards and oversight mechanisms to address proliferation concerns effectively.</li>
            <li>Re-evaluate government control over nuclear fuel to allow private sector access to emerging fuel technologies, fostering innovation.</li>
            <li>Explore insurance-based solutions to manage nuclear liability effectively without placing undue burden on the State and citizens.</li>
            <li>Ensure the effective functioning of the independently regulated AERB by fostering a competitive and diverse nuclear power sector.</li>
        </ul>
