    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Act</strong> aims to simplify India’s insurance laws and improve ease of doing business. It integrates three key acts into a single legislation:
        <ul>
            <li>Insurance Act 1938</li>
            <li>LIC Act 1956</li>
            <li>Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act 1999</li>
        </ul>
    The act seeks to create a level playing field between private and public sector insurers, as well as Indian and foreign-owned insurers, by removing special treatment for the Life Insurance Corporation.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integration of Laws:</strong> Merging multiple insurance acts into one simplifies the regulatory framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Level Playing Field:</strong> Elimination of preferential treatment for public sector undertakings and promotion of fair competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced IRDAI Powers:</strong> Strengthening the regulatory authority to protect policyholders.</li>
        <li><strong>FDI Relaxation:</strong> Increasing foreign direct investment limits in the insurance sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Industry Profitability Challenges:</strong> Addressing issues of low penetration, product suitability, and underwriting losses.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>The amendment brings significant changes to the insurance landscape. By integrating laws and removing special provisions for LIC, it promotes **fair competition**. The expanded powers of the <strong>IRDAI</strong>, including search, seizure, investigation, and penalty levying up to ₹10 crore, aim to significantly improve <strong>policyholder protection</strong>. The most notable change is the increase in <strong>FDI limit to 100 per cent</strong>, a substantial hike from the previous 74 per cent. The removal of the stipulation for a majority Indian board and top executives, now requiring only the Chairperson/MD/CEO to be an Indian resident, grants foreign investors greater management control.</p>
    <p>However, the success of increased FDI hinges on several factors. India’s life insurance market is largely a "push product" sold through hard selling, with a focus on traditional plans rather than genuine protection. General insurers face challenges with profitability due to regulated tariffs in motor insurance and mispriced risks in health and general insurance. Despite patchy industry profitability, policyholder experience regarding premiums and claims remains subpar. It is questionable whether global players will be attracted without significant changes in consumer perception and industry business models.</p>

    <h2>Constitutional / Governance Angle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease of Doing Business:</strong> Reflects the government's commitment to economic reforms and attracting investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Oversight:</strong> The enhanced powers of IRDAI signify stronger governance mechanisms within the financial sector.</li>
        <li><strong>Parliamentary Legislation:</strong> The Act is a result of parliamentary assent, demonstrating the legislative process for significant economic policy changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Policyholder Rights:</strong> The emphasis on strengthening IRDAI's powers underscores the governance principle of protecting consumer interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why it matters for UPSC</h2>
    <p>This amendment is crucial for understanding the evolving financial sector in India. It impacts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GS Paper III: Economy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization of resources, growth, development and employment.</li>
                <li>Inclusive growth and issues arising from it.</li>
                <li>Government budgeting.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>GS Paper II: Governance</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Government policies and interventions for the development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation.</li>
                <li>Development processes and the development industry the role of NGOs, SHGs, various groups and associations, donors, institutional and other beneficiaries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aspirants should focus on the economic rationale behind the reforms, their potential impact on market dynamics, and the regulatory challenges involved.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Way Forward</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus on Consumer Perception:</strong> Industry and regulator need to work towards changing the perception of insurance from an investment product to a protective one.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve Profitability:</strong> For general insurers, leaving tariffs to market forces and adopting robust data-based underwriting practices are essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Effective Utilization of IRDAI Powers:</strong> The regulator must actively use its enhanced powers to ensure fair practices and policyholder protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring FDI Inflows:</strong> The actual impact of relaxed FDI norms on capital infusion and industry growth needs to be closely monitored.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Innovation:</strong> Encouraging the development of products that meet genuine consumer needs for protection and risk management.</li>
    </ul>
